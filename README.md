# Example of FPs when scanning a .jar file with minimal content & default dates.

I'm pretty sure that the root cause of this is twofold:
1. Some index of .jar files contains the hashes of broken/incomplete releases that had almost nothing in their .jar files (I'm guessing the OSSIndex)
2. A local build produces some .jar files with matching content  

Not sure if this is something that needs to be 'fixed' in dependency-check, but thought it was worth sharing

## Repository contents
- `reproduces-issue.jar` - a JAR that reproduces the issue when scanned
- `dependency-check-report.html` - an example scan report
- `jar-with-different-modified-dates.jar` a JAR which is identical apart from modified/created dates & does not reproduce the issue (has different MD5/SHA1/SHA256) 


## Steps to reproduce
- Found with dependency-check CLI 7.4.0 installed on M1 Mac
```shell
> git clone https://github.com/paulsamuels/cve-false-positive-example
> cd cve-false-positive-example
> dependency-check --scan reproduces-issue.jar
```
The generated report identifies the jar as being multiple maven packages.


## How the issue was found:

- A java build ends up producing some .jar files that only contain a `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file 

- That file only contains the content:
```text
Manifest-Version: 1.0


```
- Both the file & it's parent `META-INF` directory have created+modified dates of `1 February 1980 at 00:00`
- A dependency check is run that scans the .jar
(Issue found in dependency-checker 7.4.0 CLI installed via homebrew)
- The dependency-check output reports (with highest confidence) that the .jar is an instance of a lot of other java packages:

The identified packages seem to exist in the Sonatype OSSIndex, but have not been published to Maven Central.
They smell like failed releases.

## Other evidence
A .jar file with content that has the same Manifest file content (but different modified dates) does not get identified as these maven packages
e.g. `jar-with-different-modified-dates.jar`
